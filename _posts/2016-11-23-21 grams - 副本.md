How many lives do we live?

How many times do we die?

They say we lose 21grams at the exact moment of our death.

Everyone.

And how much fits into 21grams?

How much is lost? When do we lose 21 grams?

How much goes with them? How much is gained?

 Twenty-one grams.

The weight of a stack of five nickels.

The weight of a hummingbird.

A chocolate bar.

How much did 21 grams weigh?
